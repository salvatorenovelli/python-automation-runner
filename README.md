# Python Automation Runner


The purpose of this script is to provide python users with a basic but powerful set of API to write simple automation and assertion scripts to create testing scenarios in native/graphic applications. 

The idea is that the runner will transparently provide a set of libraries exposing automation and assertion API in a domain language familiar to testers and QA.

**NOTE: If you need to automate web application please use [Selenium][2].**
